# A Philosophy for the New Age of Human Maturation

## Preface

Humanity is growing out of its adolescence and is beginning to more fully understand the awesome and terrifying insignificant position we play in the vastness of the universe. This collected work strives to present a Philosophy for a New Age. An age of realization and self identification as a species. An age of maturity in thought and empathy in expression. 

## Core Tenets & Argument
* Knowledge of the universe can be known. 
* Knowledge is derived from repeated observation, hypothesizing, testing, modification, and theorizing. 
* Unexplained phenomena are not supernatural in origin, but can eventually be explained by gathering more knowledge.
    * Non-evidentiary faith is not a virtue, but is ignorance. 
    * Ignorance is in opposition to knowledge.
* Human Beings are triumvirate entities, composed of a mental, physical, and emotional component.
* These components produce 6 motivations.
    1. Physical: Obtaining basic needs allowing for leisure
    2. Physical: Procreation
    3. Emotional / Physical: Consensual Touch
    4. Emotional: Recognition and admiration by one's peer for one's creative expression
    5. Mental: Gathering of Knowledge to the satisfaction of rational logic
    6. Mental / Emotional: Satisfaction of one's Morality     
* Human beings are enriched upon satisfaction of the 6 motivations. 
* The betterment and maturity of Humanity, stems from individuals applying knowledge to enrich others.
* It is Good to better Humanity; this is Morality.
* It is Right to follow institutional guidelines that facilitate the betterment of Humanity; these are Ethics.

## The Triumvirate Being 
The three components of the Human Beings are at once all within the Human, but can also be considered separately. 

* The seat of the Mental Component is the self-awareness found in Consciousness. 
* The seat of the Emotional Component is derived from interplay between Consciousness and the Biological Body.
* The seat of the Physical Component is that of the Biological Body.
    * Damage to the body can affect the other two components of a Human Being.
